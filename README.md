### Hi, I'm Austin! 

I'm currently a student at Stanford pursuing a dual Bachelors degree (B.S. Math, B.A. Data Science) and coterminal Masters degree (M.S. Computational and Mathematical Engineering). I am broadly 
interested in uses of computation in the natural sciences and social sciences, particularly in medicine and biotech.

Other than that, I'm a perma-injured tennis player, semi-retired double bassist, and Google Maps doomscroller. 

### I'd love to meet you!
