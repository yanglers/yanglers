### Hi, I'm Austin! 

I'm currently a student at Stanford pursuing a dual Bachelors degree (B.S. Math + CS, B.A. Data Science) and coterminal Masters degree (M.S. Computational and Mathematical Engineering). I am broadly interested in uses of statistical computation on systems that run society. 

### I'd love to meet you!
