### Hi, I'm Austin! 

I'm currently a student at Stanford pursuing a dual Bachelors degree (B.S. Math, B.A. Data Science) and coterminal Masters degree (Computational and Mathematical Engineering). I am broadly 
interested in uses of computation in the natural sciences and social sciences, particularly in medicine and biotech.

### I'd love to meet you!
